## Histo-Seg
First pass at conceptually refactoring semantic segmentation in whole slide histopathology images.

Histopathology images are Gigabyte-sized RGB channel images, often existing as stacked image pyramids.

Examples: 

*Use-case 1: prostate cancer growth patterns, from manual annotation

*Use-case 2: clear cell renal cancer microenviornment, from automatic Immunohistochemistry annotation

*Use-case 3: lung adenocarcinoma growth patterns, with converted Full-Connected deconvolution layers; trained on whole tile examples.
